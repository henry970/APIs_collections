# Running Newman Locally
**Step 1:** Install Node.js
To use Newman, you must have Node.js installed on your local machine.

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org.
# Verify installation by running:

**command**
node -v
npm -v
**Step 2:** Install Newman
Once Node.js is installed, you can install Newman globally using npm:

**Command:**
npm install -g newman
**Step 3:** Run a Postman Collection
To run a Postman collection using Newman locally:

**Export Postman Collection:**

In Postman, go to your collection.
Click the three dots next to the collection name and choose Export.
Save the collection as a .json file on your computer.
**Run the Collection:**

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where your collection is saved, and run the following command:

**Command:**
newman run Dome_test.postman_collection.json
Example:

**Command:**
newman run ./Demo_test.postman_collection.json
Optional: Run with Environment Variables: If you have environment variables for your API requests, you can also export and include an environment file:

**Command:**
newman run Dome_test.postman_collection.json -e 
Optional: Generate Reports: You can generate different types of reports, such as HTML:

**Command:**
newman run Dome_test.postman_collection.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export ./report.ht

Running Newman on GitHub (Using GitHub Actions)
GitHub Actions is an excellent tool for running automated tests, including Postman collections via Newman, in your CI/CD pipeline.

Step 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Navigate to Your Repository:

Go to your GitHub repository and click on the Actions tab.
Create a New Workflow:

Click New Workflow.
Choose Set up a workflow yourself (or select an existing template).
Create the Workflow File: check the yml file:

**Step 2:** Add Postman Collection to the GitHub Repository
Export Collection:
Export the Postman collection and environment file from Postman (in JSON format).
Add Files to Your Repo:
Commit and push these JSON files (e.g., Demo_test.postman_collection.json) into your GitHub repository.

**use command**
git add .
git commit -m "command change"
git push

**Step 3:** Trigger the Workflow
You can trigger the workflow manually or push a commit to the main branch to automatically trigger the workflow.

**Step 4:**  View Reports
Once the GitHub Actions run completes, navigate to the Actions tab.
Open the latest workflow run.
Under the Artifacts section, youâ€™ll find the uploaded HTML report (if you added reporting).
Download the report and open it in your browser.

# Summary
Running Newman Locally: You need to install Node.js and Newman on your machine, then run the collection using the newman run command.
Running Newman on GitHub: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate running your Postman collections in your CI/CD pipeline.
